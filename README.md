# Mega Rocket App
```
Mega rocket is an app in constant development that is designed for gyms and can be used, for example, from the moment a student wants to register for a class until the teacher can see which class he/she has been assigned, among other things.
```

## Development
### WEEK - 01

In the first week we built the UI design for the whole app in Figma, such as:

* The landing page with his differents environments (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
* The differents sections for the desktop application.

### WEEK - 02

* In this week we create the landing page with his differents sections
 without any styles so you will find an html and assets file only.

### WEEK - 03

* In this week we create the styles for the landing page so it matches
100% to the original design proposed in figma the first week.

### WEEK - 04

* In this week we recreate the styles, that we had the last week
for the landing page, in a responsive way so it fits on any
resolution (Mobile,  Tablet, Desktop), to the original design proposed
in figma the first week.


_New content will be added every week to improve it and eventually reach the expected result._
