# Mega Rocket App

 Mega rocket is an app in constant development that is designed for gyms and can be used, for example, from the moment a student wants to register for a class until the teacher can see which class he/she has been assigned, among other things.


## Development
### WEEK - 01

In the first week we built the UI design for the whole app in Figma, such as:

* The landing page with his differents environments (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
* The differents sections for the desktop application.

### WEEK - 02

* In this week we create the landing page with his differents sections
 without any styles so you will find an html and assets file only.

### WEEK - 03

* In this week we create the styles for the landing page so it matches
100% to the original design proposed in figma the first week.

### WEEK - 04

* In this week we recreate the styles, that we had the last week
for the landing page, in a responsive way so it fits on any
resolution (Mobile,  Tablet, Desktop), to the original design proposed
in figma the first week.

### WEEK - 05

* In this week we will do some exercises of JavaScript divided into different js files in the folder "exercises".
  This will be displayed on the console in an index.html file.

  field with JavaScript.

### WEEK - 07

* In this week we will continue the sign up and sign in forms validations but with the addition that once the login
 and register buttons are pressed, the saved information is sent to a web server via an HTTP request from JavaScript.
